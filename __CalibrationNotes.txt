Instructions:
1. Delete my calibration settings in settings.cc - use the defaults I added and then commented out above my changes.
2. Edit factory_test.cc - Look for comment that says “AJH” my initials. Where it says #if 0 for the dac calibration, change the zero to one.
3. Compile and flash (erase flash to enter factory test mode) - everything blinks as you are in calibration mode.
4. Turn 1st pot to zero
5. All outputs should be trying to output -1v
6. Measure all outputs
7. Turn first pot to full
8. All outputs should be trying to be 2v
9. Measure and record all voltages
10. Add to spreadsheet
11. Add dac offset and dac scale to settings.cc (leave adc scale and offset at -1 and 0 respectively
12. Change the 1 back to 0 in factory_test.cc and change the 0 to 1 for adc
13. Recompile and flash (with erase of flash)
14. Apply -1 and 2v to the time/level cv inputs for each channel and record the voltages
15. Add these to the adc section of the spreadsheet
16 Update settings.cc for adc
17. Change the factory_test.cc back to the original file or change both #if s back to 0
18 Recompile and reflash (with erase of flash).
19. Power cycle and you’re done
